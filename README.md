There is beauty in ugliness. There is beauty in chaos. Lavande is that hidden beauty in everything.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

* What browsers will Lavande work with?

Lavande makes extensive use of Flexbox, and therefore will not work well in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

* Does Lavande support any Jetpack features?

Lavande includes support for Jetpack's social media menu. A [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) account is not required. When this feature is activated, a new menu location named "Social Menu" will appear at Dashboard > Appearance > Menus > Manage Locations. Create a new menu with all of your social media networks and assign it to this location. Your new menu will appear at the bottom of your site. Lavande includes icons for the most popular social media networks.

Lavande also includes support for Jetpack's content options feature. Again, a [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) account is not required. This feature allows you to hide the post date or author when viewing either a single post or a collection of posts, such as a category or tag archive page. You can also hide the categories or tags when viewing a single post. Due to Lavande's design, no other options are supported.
